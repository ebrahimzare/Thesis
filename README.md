# Thesis
In my MSc thesis, I have developed a new algorithm for Minimum Cycle Basis(MCB) of Graphs with better time complexity. We found MCB of lexicographie and co-normal product of graphs (Section 4.6)
For MCB of join of two graphs see Theorem 4.10, page 49. Also You can see its pseudocode in MCB-Algorithm PDF file.
